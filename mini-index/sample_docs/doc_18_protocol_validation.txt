Protocol-Driven Validation for ML Systems

Protocol-driven validation defines explicit contracts for inputs, outputs, and quality gates at each pipeline stage. Unlike ad-hoc testing, protocols provide standardized acceptance criteria that are machine-verifiable and auditable.

A deliverable contract specifies the exact artifacts a pipeline must produce. For semantic indexing, the contract includes: chunks.jsonl (text segments), metadata.jsonl (per-chunk metadata), vectors.index (FAISS index), and summary.json (manifest with statistics and quality metrics).

Quality gates are pass/fail checkpoints embedded in the pipeline. Examples include: vector-chunk alignment (len(vectors) == len(chunks)), self-containment score above threshold, mid-word break rate below threshold, and encoding validity. Gates that fail halt the pipeline and produce diagnostic output.

Audit artifacts provide evidence of pipeline execution and compliance. The summary.json manifest includes: total counts, quality metrics, processing timestamps, configuration parameters, and status flags. External auditors can verify claims by inspecting these artifacts without re-running the pipeline.

Version-controlled protocols enable reproducibility across time and environments. Universal Protocol v4.23 defines the canonical contract for RAG-ready indices, including deliverable structure, quality thresholds, and verification procedures. All pipeline implementations reference this specification.
