FAISS: Fast Similarity Search at Scale

FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is an open-source library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It is widely used in production systems for nearest neighbor search across billions of vectors.

IndexFlatIP performs exact inner product search with no compression or approximation. While it provides perfect recall, its linear scan complexity makes it suitable for collections up to a few million vectors. For larger collections, approximate methods are necessary.

IndexIVF (Inverted File Index) partitions the vector space into Voronoi cells using k-means clustering. At search time, only a subset of cells are scanned, dramatically reducing search time. The nprobe parameter controls the accuracy-speed tradeoff.

Product quantization (PQ) compresses vectors by splitting them into sub-vectors and quantizing each independently. This reduces memory usage by 10-100x while maintaining reasonable search accuracy. IVFPQ combines inverted file indexing with product quantization for scalable approximate search.

GPU-accelerated FAISS can process millions of vectors per second, making it suitable for real-time applications. The library supports both single-GPU and multi-GPU configurations, with automatic memory management and batch processing capabilities.
