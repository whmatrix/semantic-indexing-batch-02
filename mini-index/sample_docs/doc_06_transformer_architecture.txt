The Transformer Architecture

The Transformer architecture, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017, revolutionized natural language processing. It replaces recurrent layers with self-attention mechanisms, enabling parallel processing of sequence elements.

Self-attention computes a weighted sum of all positions in a sequence, with weights determined by the compatibility between query and key vectors. Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.

The encoder-decoder structure of the original Transformer uses stacked layers of multi-head attention and feed-forward networks. Positional encodings provide information about token positions since the architecture lacks inherent sequential processing.

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) uses only the encoder stack and is pre-trained with masked language modeling. GPT models use only the decoder stack with causal (left-to-right) attention for autoregressive text generation.

Modern transformer variants include efficient attention mechanisms (linear attention, sparse attention), mixture-of-experts architectures, and retrieval-augmented models. These innovations address the quadratic computational cost of standard self-attention and enable processing of longer contexts.
