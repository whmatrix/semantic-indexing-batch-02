Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks in the brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes or neurons that process information using connectionist approaches. Deep learning uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input.

A neural network typically has three types of layers: input layers, hidden layers, and output layers. Each connection between neurons has a weight that adjusts during training. The learning process involves adjusting these weights to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are particularly effective for image recognition tasks. They use convolutional layers that apply filters to detect features like edges, textures, and patterns. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) handle sequential data such as text and time series by maintaining internal state.

Training neural networks requires large datasets and significant computational resources. Backpropagation is the primary algorithm for training, computing gradients of the loss function with respect to each weight. Modern frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic differentiation to simplify this process.

Transfer learning allows models trained on large datasets to be fine-tuned for specific tasks with smaller datasets. This approach has revolutionized natural language processing through models like BERT and GPT, which are pre-trained on massive text corpora and then adapted for downstream tasks.
