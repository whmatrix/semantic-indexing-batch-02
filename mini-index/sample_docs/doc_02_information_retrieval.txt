Information Retrieval Systems

Information retrieval (IR) is the activity of obtaining information system resources that are relevant to an information need from a collection of resources. Searches can be based on full-text or content-based indexing. Web search engines are the most visible IR applications.

The classic IR model includes document indexing, query processing, and relevance ranking. Documents are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space using techniques like TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) or dense embeddings. Queries are similarly represented, and relevance is computed using similarity measures.

Vector space models represent documents and queries as vectors in a shared space. Cosine similarity and inner product are common similarity metrics. Dense retrieval methods use neural network encoders to create semantic embeddings that capture meaning beyond keyword matching.

FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It provides implementations of various indexing structures including flat (brute-force), IVF (inverted file), and HNSW (hierarchical navigable small world) graphs.

Evaluation metrics for IR systems include precision, recall, F1-score, mean average precision (MAP), and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG). These metrics measure different aspects of retrieval quality and are essential for comparing system performance.
