ArXiv: Open Access Scientific Research

ArXiv is an open-access repository of electronic preprints covering physics, mathematics, computer science, and related fields. The machine learning section (cs.LG) alone contains hundreds of thousands of papers spanning foundational theory to cutting-edge applications.

ArXiv abstracts provide concise summaries of research contributions, making them ideal for building topic-aware search indices. Each paper includes structured metadata: arxiv_id, title, authors, abstract, categories, and submission date. This metadata enables both semantic and faceted search.

The RedPajama dataset provides cleaned, deduplicated ArXiv content in a standardized format. Processing involves extracting text from the JSONL format, chunking abstracts and full text into embedding-friendly segments, and maintaining provenance links to the original arxiv_id.

Scientific text presents unique challenges for embedding models. Technical vocabulary, mathematical notation, and domain-specific acronyms require models trained on academic text. Models like E5-large-v2, trained on diverse corpora including scientific text, handle these challenges effectively.

Building a semantic index over ArXiv papers enables cross-disciplinary discovery. Researchers can find related work across different subfields using natural language queries rather than relying on exact keyword matches or citation networks.
